A Health Concern is a health related matter that is of interest, importance or worry to someone, who may be the patient, patient's family or patient's health care provider. Health concerns are derived from a variety of sources within an EHR (such as Problem List, Family History, Social History, Social Worker Note, etc.). Health concerns can be medical, surgical, nursing, allied health or patient-reported concerns. Problem Concerns are a subset of Health Concerns that have risen to the level of importance that they typically would belong on a classic “Problem List”, such as “Diabetes Mellitus” or “Family History of Melanoma” or “Tobacco abuse”. These are of broad interest to multiple members of the care team. Examples of other Health Concerns that might not typically be considered a Problem Concern include “Risk of Hyperkalemia” for a patient taking an ACE-inhibitor medication, or “Transportation difficulties” for someone who doesn't drive and has trouble getting to appointments, or “Under-insured” for someone who doesn't have sufficient insurance to properly cover their medical needs such as medications. These are typically most important to just a limited number of care team members.",

This section often includes notable results such as abnormal values or relevant trends, and could record all results for the period of time being documented. Laboratory results are typically generated by laboratories providing analytic services in areas such as chemistry, hematology, serology, histology, cytology, anatomic pathology, microbiology, and/or virology. These observations are based on analysis of specimens obtained from the patient and submitted to the laboratory. Imaging results are typically generated by a clinician reviewing the output of an imaging procedure, such as when a cardiologist reports the left ventricular ejection fraction based on the review of an echocardiogram. Procedure results are typically generated by a clinician wanting to provide more granular information about component observations made during the performance of a procedure, such as when a gastroenterologist reports the size of a polyp observed during a colonoscopy. Note that there are discrepancies between CCD and the lab domain model, such as the effectiveTime in specimen collection.",
