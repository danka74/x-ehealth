If it refers to a composite element (e.g. a section, a list; a label concept) the presence of the included elements is determined by the conformance rules of these sub-elements.
Recipient shall understand mandatory elements.
If a ‘mandatory’ element is missing then the document is no longer a conformant IPS.

If it refers to a composite element (e.g. a section, a list; a label concept a complex data type) the presence of the included elements is determined by the conformance rules of these sub-elements.
Recipient shall understand required elements.
If a ‘required’ element is missing then the document is no longer a conformant IPS.

		<display value="Required, if known"/>
		<definition value="A “Required if known” element is one that should be provided.
If there is information available, the element must be present and - where applicable - valorised with valid values.
If there is no information available, the element may be omitted, may be left empty, or may be valorised with exceptional or null values depending on the implementation.
If it refers to a composite element (e.g. a section, a list, a label concept, a complex data type) the presence of the included elements is determined by the conformance rules of these sub-elements.
Recipient shall understand required elements.
A derived model (that includes also implementable specifications) shall maintain an equivalent conformance strength; or may further constrain it (e.g. from ‘RK’ to ‘R’)."/>
	</concept>
	<concept>
		<code value="C"/>
		<display value="Conditional (has associated condition predicates)"/>
		<definition value="Depending on predicate conditions the element may assume different conformance strengths (e.g. O, R, RK) or not being present.
A predicate can be simple (for example: «element A exists»; «attribute b = value1») or complex (for example: «element C exists» AND «the attribute x of element D = value2).
A conditional element may be evaluated on a single condition (if predicate A then ‘Required’ else ‘Optional’) or on multiple conditions (e.g. if predicate A then ‘Required’; if predicate B then ‘Optional’; else ‘Not Present’).
The resulting conformance strength (M, R, RK, O, ...) is determined by the conditions.
If it refers to a composite element (e.g. a section, a list, a label concept, a complex data type) the presence of the included elements is determined by the combination of the predicate conditions of this element and the conformance rules of its sub-elements. For example:
1.	no exception is raised if a required sub-element is missing, when the parent is correctly omitted.
2.	an exception is raised if a required sub-element is missing, when the parent is present.
Derived models or implementable specifications shall maintain an equivalent conformance strength; but it is allowed to modify the conformance strength if the predicate condition permits.
Recipient shall understand conditional elements, when required. For example, a conditional element that could be optional or not present could be omitted by a derived model and ignored by a recipient. Or, a condition for which a conditional element become required doesn’t apply to a jurisdiction, in that case a jurisdictional specification could omit that element and recipient could ignore it.
Depending on the conditions, exception is or is not raised if the data are missing."/>

	<concept>
		<code value="O"/>
		<display value="Optional"/>
		<definition value="This data element can be omitted from a derived model, including from implementations.
Recipient may ignore optional elements.
If it refers to a composite element (e.g. a section, a list, a label concept, a complex data type) the presence of the included elements is determined by the presence of this element and the conformance rules of its sub-elements. For example, no exception is raised if a required sub-element is missing, when the parent is omitted.
The reason for specifying the optional data elements is to ensure that both sender and recipient use the appropriate semantic interpretation of these elements.
No exception is raised if the data are missing."/>
